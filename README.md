Used for creating a web server </br></br>
All of this code makes use of the [Socket library from the Ruby Standard  Library](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.1/libdoc/socket/rdoc/Socket.html)  (stdlib) </br>
More specifically, the TCPServer and TCPSocket objects. </br></br>
To connect to your server, open your browser to [http://localhost:2000](http://localhost:2000) </br>
While the code is executing, it puts example header and body text to terminal after requests and responses are made. </br>
When entering index.html as part of the URL, the Ruby code opens the file and puts the content on the client.
